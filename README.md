# Beginning Server-Side Application Development with Angular
In this course we will learn how to use Angular to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that has great support for SEO. To understand what this exactly means we need to dissect the terms in the last sentence. A Progressive Web App is a regular web app that are enhanced to work on mobile, with support for working offline or with slow connections et. al. Building support for SEO means that search engines can read and understand the pages, and that the pages have dynamic data the is specifically aimed to search engines (meta tags). We will end with a dynamic single page web application that behaves like a server-rendered application.
